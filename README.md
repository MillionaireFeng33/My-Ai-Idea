# SMART TRADE AI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

SmartTradeAI - An intelligent system that combines real-time market analysis with predictive AI to suggest optimal retail trading opportunities while managing risk. 


## Background

Problem: Retail traders often struggle with emotional decision-making, information overload, and lack of sophisticated analysis tools available to institutional traders. Studies show 70-90% of retail traders lose money.

Motivation: As someone who has experienced both the exhilaration and frustration of retail trading, I want to democratize access to advanced trading analytics. This system could help balance the playing field for individual investors.

## How is it used?

Users:

- Retail traders with basic market knowledge

- Investment club members

- Financial advisors serving individual clients

Usage Context:

- Daily trading decision support

- Portfolio rebalancing suggestions

- Risk management alerts

- Educational tool for new traders

Code examples:
```
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from alpha_vantage.timeseries import TimeSeries

# Configuration
API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
TICKER = 'AAPL'

# 1. Data Collection
def get_market_data():
    ts = TimeSeries(key=API_KEY, output_format='pandas')
    data, _ = ts.get_daily(symbol=TICKER, outputsize='compact')
    return data

# 2. Feature Engineering
def preprocess_data(data):
    data = data[['4. close']]
    data['returns'] = data.pct_change()
    data['sma_10'] = data['4. close'].rolling(10).mean()
    data['sma_50'] = data['4. close'].rolling(50).mean()
    data.dropna(inplace=True)
    return data

# 3. LSTM Model for Price Prediction
def build_lstm_model(X_train):
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(LSTM(50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], 1)))
    model.add(LSTM(50))
    model.add(Dense(1))
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
    return model

# 4. Random Forest for Trade Signal
def build_rf_model(X, y):
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
    model.fit(X, y)
    return model

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Get and prepare data
    raw_data = get_market_data()
    processed_data = preprocess_data(raw_data)
    
    # Prepare features and targets
    X = processed_data[['returns', 'sma_10', 'sma_50']].values
    y = (processed_data['returns'].shift(-1) > 0).astype(int)  # Binary prediction
    
    # Train models
    lstm_model = build_lstm_model(X)
    rf_model = build_rf_model(X[:-1], y[:-1])
    
    # Make prediction
    latest_data = X[-1].reshape(1, -1)
    prediction = rf_model.predict(latest_data)
    print(f"Predicted market direction: {'UP' if prediction[0] == 1 else 'DOWN'}")
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Data Sources:

- Real-time market data (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage APIs)

- Historical price/volume data

- News sentiment analysis

- Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)

- Alternative data (social media trends, economic indicators)

AI Techniques:

- LSTM neural networks for price prediction

- Reinforcement learning for strategy optimization

- NLP for news sentiment analysis

- Random Forests for risk assessment

## Challenges

Limitations:

- Cannot predict black swan events

- Requires continuous data updates

- Past performance doesn't guarantee future results

- Regulatory constraints on automated trading

- Market liquidity considerations

## What next?

Growth Opportunities:

- Integration with brokerage APIs for execution

- Mobile app development

- Social trading features

- Advanced risk modeling

- Alternative data integration (satellite imagery, shipping data)


## Acknowledgments

I drew inspiration and utilized resources from the following:

- Alpha Vantage API – For real-time and historical market data.

- TensorFlow/Keras Documentation – For LSTM model implementation.

- Scikit-learn – For Random Forest and feature engineering.

- "Advances in Financial Machine Learning" (Marcos López de Prado) – For theoretical foundations in quant finance. 

This prototype demonstrates the core functionality while leaving room for expansion into a full-featured trading assistant. The system combines both traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches to provide actionable trading insights.
